Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels. You choose how you would like to learn. Do you want to take on increasingly difficult challenges? Maybe you prefer training through repetition and by improving your solutions. After solving a task, compare your answer with other users and learn from them or help less experienced users by answering their questions.

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new account on Codewars, configure it for an optimal training experience, and become familiar with basic elements of the user interface. Soon you will be able to face the challenges collected in Codewars' library and start learning!
